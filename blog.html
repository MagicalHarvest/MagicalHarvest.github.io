  <h2>May 01,2022 - Alchemy and Magic </h2>

<b>New: </b>
And again 2 weeks are over. The last two weeks were blessed with progress! In addition to
potions with status effects (such as temporarily run faster, exp increase) are now also potions
in the game, with which you can cast magic. And it's great to clear the farm or prepare the fields with them. <br>
Accordingly, alchemy is now (finally) in the game. The previous crafting system will also be
replaced by the new principle. Along with alchemy, cooking and tailoring are also implemented (but still without proper recipes).
  <br><br>

 </div>
  The first 10 herbs have found their way into the game - at least in item form for the inventory. 3D models are still pending.
  <br><br>
Currently there are 6 different spells in the game (names and current visual effects are placeholders).<br>
  <ul>
  <li> Wind spell -> for harvesting crops </li>
 <li> Scythe spell -> to cut grass on the farm (we have grass now!) </li>
   <li> "Smash" spell -> to destroy stones on the farm (yes, stones exist now too)  </li>
    <li> Storm spell -> destroys trees and farm plants or farm soil </li>
    <li> Rain spell -> waters farm soil / plants </li>
  <li> Earth spell -> digs the soil to farm ground </li>
</ul>
With the implementation of animals, more spells will be added to take care of the animals. <br>
Marie has made more animal concepts and it promises to be very interesting.

<br>
<br>
Otherwise, some minor improvements have been made based on our mid-April playtest, such as
simple feedback when an item is collected. <br><br>
 <img src="images/blog/2022-05-01_T5Cow.png" alt="cowsheep"  height="200px" class ="blogImagesLeft"></a>
  <b>Outlook: </b>
The next step is the evolution system of the plants and the soil quality or the quality of the farm plants.
Time is a bit tight at the moment, because I'm learning Swedish more intensively at the same time. Therefore
I expect that it will take about two weeks to implement this properly.
  <br><br> In addition, I'm allowing myself a little more free time and have reduced my 70-hour week to about 55-60 hours
  of work per week. In general, the programming progress of the features looks very good!<br> <br>
In May the Steam-page will be reworked as well! Currently we have just over 300 wishlist entries. Additionally a <b>Patreon page</b> is planned.

  <h2>April 15, 2022 - Crafting </h2>

  <i><u>Isa</u></i>: <br>
<b>New: </b>
Cooking and alchemy are still missing, however crafting is ready. I had less time to implement new content, because
I reworked the input system, as this didn't work anymore due to an engine update. However, now everything is playable
with the controller again and also some bugs are fixed, which will be beneficial in the future. <br><br>
    <img src="images/blog/2022-04-15_farmhouse.png" alt="farmhouse"  height="200px" class ="blogImagesLeft"></a>
The first farmhouse model is done and also the T4 and T5 strawberry models (although T5 will still be worked on graphically).
 The day-night cycle has been revised and the lighting conditions improved.<br>
We also have a few more fish, including a starfish.
<img src="images/blog/2022-04-15_strawberries.png" alt="strawberry"  height="200px" class ="blogImagesRight"></a>

<br><br>

On 04/16/2022 we have a first playtest with outsiders and are very excited!
This will be mostly about fishing and farming.<br><br>

  <b>Outlook: </b>
In the 2nd half of April, cooking and alchemy are definitely on the agenda. Based on this will be the processing of
crops into seeds, which at the same time brings the possibility of upgrading the seeds one Tier-level. For the next
time, the focus is more on implementing new features.

  <h2>April 01, 2022 - Early development trailer </h2>
  <p>
    <img src="images/otherImages/WIPHouse.png" alt="WIPbuilding"  height="200px" class ="blogImagesRight"></a>
  <i><u>Isa</u></i>: <br>
<b>New: </b>
I took a break for a week, where I focused more on character concepts (e.g. the clothing style of the races).
I also started with the 3D-creation and texturing of the first farmhouse.<br>

The action "make the game visually prettier" is finished. Of course, it is not a final graphic yet,
but we are approaching the direction of the style.<br>
Fishing is semi-finished for now. There are now two fishing modes: one with mini-game,
which increases the chance to catch higher quality fish, and one without mini-game. In addition,
simple objects can now be fished (the obligatory boot, for example).<br><br>

Based on the visual adaptation, we have created a trailer that shows the current state of the game.
It is the result of 4 months of work, of course all the background work is not visible.
You can find the trailer on the homepage (<a href="ger_index.html"><u>Home</u></a>).<br><br>

  <b>Character-artist:</b>
  We have a character artist now who will draw the characters for us!<br>
  <a href="https://www.artstation.com/ulfenheim" target="_blank"><u>Arstation: Ulfenheim</u></a><br>
  Normally he has a darker style, but for Magical Harvest he has adapted his style and will create wonderful
  artwork for us. You can see one of the test characters in our trailer.<br>
  Based on his style, the Steam-page will be reworked and all the Steam-images will be adapted.
  <br><br>

  <b>What's next?: </b>
  Until mid-April, I plan to implement all the crafting elements into the game. This means the normal crafting,
  cooking and alchemy. Since the newly implemented game elements are done directly with the new UI style, the
  implementation will take a bit longer now.<br>
  I also want to finish the first farmhouse, of course, as well as more crop models. I will probably start again
  with the spring crops and do directly the T4 and T5 models, which I have left out so far.
  I want to have my moon potato!<br>
  Marie will continue to create fish and design the story.

<b>News: </b>
Last weekend I finished a picture that can be used for our steampage for now. According to that I also finished
the rough version of the steampage, but it still needs to be filled with life. But the most important information
is there for now (I hope - I'm open for suggestions!). Feel free to get in touch in Discord in our channel!).
<br><br>
<b>UI:</b>
I've also started the process of revamping the UI. The placeholder UI is not very nice to look at and with a new UI
the game feels completely different. <br>
But I'm amazed at how much time this is taking! It took me almost a whole day just for the toolbar! It's not finished yet either,
as some elements aren't optimal yet, but it's definitely more worth seeing than before (which isn't hard).
<br><br>

<b>Fish and "Shinies": </b>
On the side, Marie continues to make fish to fill the fishing game with. There is also a special feature in our game that we decided
to add this week: <br>
Special fish colors (equivalent to the Shinies in Pokémon). To make fishing feel even more meaningful, after all, these can then be
viewed in the fish book.
<br><br>

<b>What next?: </b>
My goal this week and next is to visually spruce up the game a bit. <br>
This includes the UI, the game environment (Environment) and the fishing game would also like effects. <br>
I'm still missing the wheat for the summer crops, and I won't continue with these 3D models until April, since
 the visual part has top priority right now.

  <i><u>Isa</u></i>: <br>

  This blog post is getting a bit longer as I summarize our journey of about 4 months. In the future, shorter, <b>2-weekly updates</b> will occur to report the progress.<br>
<br>
    We started planning Magical Harvest in early November 2021. November and December consisted more of testing and trying out from a programmer's point of view,
    while on the side the concept phase for the first game elements progressed.<br>
    <b>Programming of the first content: </b>
    In January, the actual programming work began. Unfortunately, it is not possible to start immediately with features that are directly visible to the player.
     First of all, a data management system had to be created to handle all the items in the game and to be able to integrate them easily into the game.
     This was followed by the creation of the inventory system and the grid system, since the main player action is based on them.<br>
Before that and also in between, the day-night system was added, a calendar, the player's stamina - things that run alongside in the game.
Also, the first interacting with farm tiles to sow seeds, water plants and be able to harvest them.<br>
<b>Decorating and fishing:</b>
    <img src="images/featureImages/fishing.png" alt="fishing"  height="200px" class ="blogImagesLeft">
In February I focused mainly on the decorating mode, since it is based on the game grid and much depends on the logic behind it. Now you can decorate the farm (and the player house) after all!<br>
Then 2 weeks ago I replaced the placeholder character I had been using until then. After 5 days of learning how to create 3D characters, I created a more nicer looking test player character.
After that I started to implement the fishing minigame, which I will finish this week. At least in the rough version.
<br><br>
    <b>Assets: </b>
    Everything I'm currently doing needs to be spruced up, of course. Sound effects, more animations, UI, real 3D assets - all that is missing.
    The current assets are 95% placeholders. So all the game objects and the user interface.<br>
    We are not professional 3D artists and still need someone for this role, nevertheless we try to create some assets ourselves to be able to show
    a preliminary, rough direction of the game. For example, I'm already creating the first crops and because of our system that's quite a few!
    <br><br>
    <b>Not much in 3 months, right?: </b> Yes and no. It doesn't look like much, but next du the current "finished" game-features is more:<br>
    Making the homepage, preparing the Steam-page, learning and implementing 3D-modeling and texturing, planning the game, creating concepts (written and art),
    planning the story and characters... and more.
    <br><br>
    <img src="images/featureImages/farming.png" alt="farming"  height="200px" class ="blogImagesRight">
    <b>Time allocation? : </b>
    I program around 40% of my working day on the game (and I work around 10-12h/day on it), around 45% art, concept or other, and around 5% social media (tendency increasing here).
    We're hoping for a successful Kickstarter campaign in fall to at least be able to hire artists.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Next:</b>
    This week I will finish programming the fishing minigame, as far as it is possible in the current state of the game.
    This includes painting a few more 2D icons for the fish and the preliminary fishing rod. Along the way, my goal is to
    finish creating the 3D models for the summer field crops.
    <br> <br>
    The next blog entry will already be next week, as the long term plan is to write a blog at the beginning of a month and the middle of a month.
