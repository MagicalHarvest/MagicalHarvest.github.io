           <h1>Cultivate plants and evolve them!</h1>
           <p>
             With the special evolution system there are a many different plants to discover.
             There are 5 different versions of one type of plant - 2 non-magical variants and 3
              magical variants. Who would not be able to resist the delicious taste of the moon
               potato?<br>
             There are different types of plants that can be cultivated on the farm:
             crops, trees, flowers and herbs.

  <h1>Adopt farm animals</h1>
  <p>
    Give a home to animals on your farm. From a small chicken to a full-grown dragon.
    Build a bond through good care to profit from their products.
    Through breeding and selective feeding, you have the chance to develop a new
    magical species. Each species has at least two magical breeds and some can be
    crossed to get more breeds and species. The next generation of your chickens,
    could be your first generation of phoenixes.<br>
    Non-magical animals can be purchased from the merchant and need good care and
    attention to produce better products. Only a contented cow will give high quality milk.<br><br>

   The basic species:

  <ul>
    <li> Lizard</li>
    <li> Hare</li>
    <li> Chicken</li>
    <li> Horse</li>
    <li> Cattle</li>
    <li> Sheep</li>
    <li> Goat</li>
  </ul>

      <h1>A home for pets</h1>
 <p>
   Pets not only love to cuddle, but also help with the farm. So dogs, as well as a
   magical cat species can herd farm animals out of the barn and back in, and cats bring
   gifts now and then.<br>
 Pets can also be bred to magical species, expanding their abilities, whether for gift
 hunting or driving farm animals.

 <h1>Decorate your farm</h1>
 <p>
   You can craft many things to decorate your farm. From impressive statues, to
   elegant fences and cozy armchairs. But decorations can also have a functionality.
    How about a water trough for the animals? <br>
Magical Harvest offers a special decoration system, in which it is
possible to use not only the classic 1x1 grid system. Special elements can
be placed between the grid, or in the corners, such as fences or lamps. This
 allows for even more variations in decorating.<br><br>

Another unusual feature is the decoration mode: with this mode it is easy to set decorations on the farm, adjust or undo changes without having to run back and forth.
