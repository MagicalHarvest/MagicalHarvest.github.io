            <li><h3>When will the game be released?</h3>
              Early access might happen in <b>autumn 2023</b>. <br>
              Full release might be 1-2 years later, depending on how fast we can manage to get
              assets and content into the game, fixing bugs etc.

            <li><h3>Who is developing the game?</h3>
             <b>Isa</b> and <b>Marie</b>, two german game developers who are living in
            <u> <a href="https://www.spelkollektivet.com/" target="_blank">Spelkollektivet</a></u> in Sweden.<br>
            We love animals, have 3 cats and since we are fans of farming-games we are putting a lot of
            effort and love in this project. <br>
            We are both more specialised in programming which is the reason the art part takes longer and is not final.
            After the Kickstarter-campaign we want to hire one or two artists for the game to help out with that.
            </li>

    <div class="DecoLine"></div>

            <li><h3>Kickstarter?</h3>
            Kickstarter will happen in autumn 2022. The plan is, to have a small demo-version to show until that.<br>
            To work completely fulltime on the project and to hire at least one artist we will need money.<br><br>
            The backers of the Kickstarter campaign that are spending a certain amount receive a Steam-key for the game
            (the game will be more expensive later).
            </li>

    <div class="DecoLine"></div>

            <li><h3>Target-platform?</h3>
            PC and distribution via Steam. Controller support included.<br>
            If everything goes well, Nintendo Switch is the next target-platform.
            </li>

    <div class="DecoLine"></div>

          <li><h3>Steam-page?</h3>
          In development. Will be finished towards the end of March.
