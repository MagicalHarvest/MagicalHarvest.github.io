            <li><h3>Who is developing the game?</h3>
             <b>Isa</b> and <b>Marie</b>, two female, german game developers who are living in
            <u> <a href="https://www.spelkollektivet.com/" target="_blank">Spelkollektivet</a></u> in Sweden.<br>
            We love animals, have 3 cats and since we are fans of farming-games we are putting a lot of
            effort and love in this project. <br>
            We are both more specialised in programming, but we can also do the 3D-Assets for Magical Harvest ourselves.
            </li>
