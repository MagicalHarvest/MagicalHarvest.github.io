            Dragonreath is run by 3 factions, each of which lives out its own ideas about magic.<br>
           The city is divided accordingly into three districts, where the inhabitants live their daily lives.

   <h3>Shailyn-Order</h3>
    <p>
      The Shailyn-Order focuses on pure magic and the 'scientific' aspect. In their opinion, magic
      is connected to everything and flows back and forth, with the nodes being the stars.
       Thus, the Order is very focused on the stars and the cosmos. The Shailyn-Order experiments a
       lot with magic and tries to improve the world with it and with spells.<br>
In the eyes of the Shailyn-Order, they are the most important faction, because magic and knowledge
is everything in their opinion. Anyone who claims otherwise and does not study the 'real' magic
is beneath them.<br>
Because of the disappearance of magic, the order is in quite a turmoil and they are desperately
trying to find out the reason and how to solve the problem. Thus, they are very fixated on their
own studies.
    </p>

   <h3>Sidus-Alliance</h3>
      <p>
        The Sidus-Alliance is ancient, and according to their beliefs, true magic is the light itself.
        Magic can only be powerful if it is pure and connected to the light. The Sidus-Alliance does not
        deny that other forms of magic exist, but in their eyes it is only an abstract, misguided type of magic.
        For this reason, they also have a problem with the Obsideran-Pact, as the members of that particularly
        contaminate and destroy magic.<br>
  With the disappearance of magic, the relationship between these two factions is more strained than ever. The Sidus-Alliance 
  blames the Obsideran-Pact for the disappearance, and if they weren't so busy saving magic with sacred rituals,
  they would probably try to harm the Obsideran Pact.
</p>

   <h3>Obsideran-Pact</h3>
      <p>
        The Obsideran-Pact is strongly connected to the darkness. They believe, the darkness is the origin of everything:
        life begins in the darkness before you are born and ends with you returning to the darkness. Accordingly, the same is
        true of magic.<br>
        To exploit the power of magic, they use dark rituals. They believe in the power of the strongest and see predators
        that hunt at night as a kind of role model. <br>
        The disappearance of magic has made relations with the other factions more sensitive, especially with the Sidus-Alliance, as they see the 
        Obsideran-Pact as the source of the problem. Fortunately, they are immersing themselves
        in their dark rituals to bring back magic instead of seeking violence.

      <div class="TextAlignLeft">
<p>
<ul>
  <li><h3>Humans</h3>
<p>
  Probably the most adaptable race of Hyldenas is that of humans. While they were once not appreciated by the other races,
  they have since more than proven themselves. They have produced great mages, as well as healers, explorers, and discoverers. <br>
  Humans are very flexible and often approach things in new ways instead of walking old paths. Typically, they connect everything
  they see and experience, which can also be discovered in their style of clothing and lifestyle.<br>
  Because of their adaptability, they can be found in all factions and stubbornly try to show that even species that don't have the
  'natural gift' can be just as successful as long as you have the passion for it.
</p>
   </li>
  <li><h3>Elves</h3>
<p>
  Elves are considered by many to be particularly graceful and majestic. They stand out because of their long pointed ears and their
  majesty. Elves often seem perfect in everything they do. This is probably because they rarely deviate from their way of doing things
  and try new things. <br>
  Elves like to be seen as mythical and are originally very connected to magic by nature, so the loss of magic hits elves especially hard.
   Because elves are careful to maintain their reputation and be untouched by worldly things, they are also often described as arrogant.<br>
  For elves, light is very sacred, so it is not surprising that they are found in the Sidus-Alliance.
</p>
  </li>

  <li><h3>Drakys</h3>
    A proud species, but distrustful of other species. Drakys are characterized by their scaly tails, horns, and scales that
    protect part of their skin. Because of their appearance and the coincidence that the black dragons disappeared
    when this species first appeared, the myth arose that they were descendants of those black dragons.<br>
    Because of this myth, the belief that they could turn into dragons and destroy whole areas, existed for a long
    time, and they were persecuted for it. However, with time this belief disappeared and the Drakys, who originally
    lived in the mountains, began to live with the other species in the cities.<br>
    The Drakys are more likely to be found in the Obsideran-Pact, because they are naturally more gifted in the use of dark
    magic. However, they are valued not only for their talent with dark magic in the Obsideran-Pact, but also for their
    alchemical talent. But not everyone appreciates this, and some still believe that they make poisons rather than useful
    alchemical potions.
  </li>
  <li><h3>Nereids</h3>
<p>
  Due to the fact that their former home - a city in the sea - was destroyed, Nereids had to get used to life on land.
  As a result, they are more open to new experience and curious about the life on land. Nevertheless, they are always surrounded
  by a longing for the sea.<br>
Some of them have the goal to rebuild their old homeland, but they also appreciate the advantages of country life: varied food,
the exchange with the other peoples and cultures, but also the expansion of their knowledge with the use of magic.<br>
Even though they have now fully adapted to a life on the land, their culture is still closely linked to the ocean,
as well as to the moon and the stars, which determine the tides.
That is why Nereids are often represented in the Shailyn-Order, but there are also some representatives of this species who prefer
the Obsideran-Pact.
</p>
  </li>
  <li><h3>Ki'shen</h3>
<p>
  These people were once blessed by the gods and are now closely associated with animals. Ki'shen have the gift of calming
  magical creatures and befriending them. They typically have animal ears that help them hear better, as well as tails that
  help them with balance.<br>
  Ki'Shen are very open-minded and optimistic by nature, which they often express with bright, friendly colors in their clothing.
  However, due to the disappearance of magic and the associated disappearance of magical beings, many Ki'shen lose their optimistic
  attitude.<br>
  They believe in the connection between magical creatures and the cosmos, which is why they invariably join the Shailyn-Order.
