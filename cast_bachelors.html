            Kyle comes from a family that have been residents of Dragonreath since the beginning and have given shape to the city as blacksmiths and architects. As the blacksmith of Dragonreath, Kyle is mostly involved in repair work within the city. When he is not busy repairing, he likes to make trinkets and is showing an attention to detail.
            <br><br>He despises magic and believes that the catastrophe was only a matter of time, as magic, in his opinion, never does any good. However, his goal is to work with a high quality magical ore one day to better understand the differences between magical and normal ore. Probably his works could be made even better through magic, if only he could put down his hatred.

            Flowers are the most important thing in Ri'kin's life, which is the reason why he opened a flower store in Dragonreath. If you’re looking for flowers, you’re in the best hands with his help. He knows stories of magical flowers, even those that no longer exist in Hyldena after the catastrophe. When he can share something about his colorful plants, he’s passionate and outgoing - unlike his usual self. 
            <br><br>Ri'kin is a shy, often gloomy-looking Ki'shen. Other Ki'shen, who are normally very playful and open-hearted, avoid him as a result. Since he is new to the city and hasn’t made any friends yet, he is lonely and only feels comfortable in the presence of his flowers. When his customers show interest in them, Ri'kin begins to open up. 
            <br><br>The truth is, Ri'kin would like to be closer to others, but he always loses heart when he sets out to approach new people. However, someone may be able to help him...

        Azriel is known for his friendly and helpful character. Valariel is often spotted near him, which doesn't seem to bother him.
        <br><br>Since Azriel is also known for his magical talent, it is quite surprising that he studies magic in his own teahouse instead of the Sidus-alliance. Had his Uncle Ethaniel not been the leader of the Sidus-Alliance, Azriel would probably be more likely in the Shailyn-Order, as he feels more connected to the stars and the cosmos.
        <br><br>There is tension between his uncle and him, and it seems like it has something to do with the catastrophe, but he doesn't want to talk about it.

         Valariel lives outside the city in the dark forest and avoids being seen by others. The brother of Neria is strongly connected to the darkness, so it is no surprise that he belongs to the Obsideran Pact. Since he reveals little of himself, he is difficult to judge. However, he is described as cool, distant and, above all, dangerous.
        <br><br>He is a Drakys who is convinced that his kind descended from the black dragons. Therefore, he can be found in many different places searching for information on this subject. 
        <br><br>Although he prefers to keep to himself, he also seems to be around Azriel quite often. Is there a connection between them?

      <br><br> His protective instinct and self-imposed obligation keep him from exploring the world, which is his dream. He is adventurous, does not shy away from any
        danger, but this can also be his doom...
