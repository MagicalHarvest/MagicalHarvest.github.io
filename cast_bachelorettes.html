              To help the people during the famine, Lyris devoted herself to farm life. On her farm south of the city, she grows simple crops, but she does not harvest enough to put an end to the hardship. She is very convinced of her capabilities, and believes that the reason she can't produce enough yields is due to the land and her gods.
              <br><br>She knows a lot about crops and also about those that have disappeared from Hyldena since the catastrophe, as she certainly studies the old books about agriculture. However, she has not yet been able to put her theoretical knowledge into practice in order to cultivate magical plants again.
              <br><br>Despite her friendliness, she shows a reluctant attitude towards better farmers, and is not sympathetic to the gods. The latter could be her undoing...

            <br><br>The decline of magic definitely weighs on her mind, as it causes magical creatures to disappear. Most of all, she would like to see more magical creatures, as she has only seen one once in her life when she was very young.
            <br><br>She owns a dog, but it has disappeared and she is desperately looking for it. Hopefully nothing has happened to her dog...

       Elwyn is a priestess in the Sidus-Alliance, who believe that light is the core of magic. The elf knows a lot about the different beliefs of magic and although she is a priestess of light, she sees a true aspect in all of them. In her opinion, it would be best if everyone would unite and consider magic as a whole, rather than placing importance on whether it comes from the light, the dark, or the cosmos. 
       <br><br>She is friendly and dreamy, but sometimes a shadow settles over her face that comes from her past. Some things are not so easy to forget and this becomes her undoing every now and then.

        A Drakys, who has her own herb store. Neria seems kind and very close to nature. She tries to be friendly and polite to others, and has trouble attracting new customers to her store.
        <br><br>Neria came to Dragonreath after the disaster and would like to know what nature looked like before the loss of magic.
        <br><br>At first glance, she doesn't seem like a typical Drakys, as she avoids conflict and tries to help where she can. Here and there, many also believe that her friendly nature is just a facade. Maybe it's time to find out if this is true and how much Drakys is in her.

      Every now and then she tends to embarrass others with flirtations, but only if she knows the other person understands the fun. 
      She is not afraid of hard work for her friends, as long as she can wash the dirt out of her clothes. 
      <br><br> Despite her rather open nature, she is very cautious when it comes to really trusting someone. As if she's afraid that they might find out something about her that no one should know...</td>
