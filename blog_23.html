      <h2>February 01, 2023  - Animals, Town and Daytimes</h2>

          Hello all! 
          <br>
          <br>We hope you are well and enjoying your time! 
          <br>As huge Harry Potter fans, we are really looking forward to Hogwarts Legacy - what about you? There's magic happening as well! 
          <br>  Since we will be playing more, we are now focusing more on Magical Harvest and a lot has been added in the last 2 weeks.
          <br>
          <br> <b>Animals</b>
          <br> As you know, I (Isa) worked on the animations of the animals. This is quite tedious and not very exciting, which is why I switched to other areas from time to time. We now have animations for the first animals, which are already integrated into the game.
          <a href="gifs/Animal_2.gif" target="_blank">
            <img src="gifs/Animal_2.gif"  alt="Animals" height="250px" class ="blogImagesRight"></img>
          </a>
          <br> The "breeding mini-game" is also already implemented in the basics, but still needs to be spruced up, for which more species assets are needed, which have been put on hold for this area for now. We really need someone else to help us with the assets.... That would speed up the process a lot. 
          <br> It is now possible to interact with the animals, take them out of the barn and put them back in the barn, and they produce products. 
          <br> 
          <br> <b>Day-night cycle</b>
          <br> Previously, we had a day-night cycle where the sun moved across the sky. Unfortunately, this resulted in flickering shadows, which looked quite annoying, and in general I didn't like the effect very much. Now we have transitions between the times of day at 9am, 5pm and 9pm respectively. At these times, the daytime-state changes from morning to noon, noon to evening, and evening to night. This is a much better indication of when the daytime-state changes (which is important when fishing, for example), and it looks much better too!

            <img src="gifs/DaytimeTransition.gif"  alt="Daytime" height="250px" class ="blogImagesRight"></img>
          </a>
          <br> 
          <br> <b>The city Dragonreath</b>
          <br>The city will need a lot of assets. Since I don't like to work with ugly placeholder-cubes for testing, I started creating the city (for a change from animations). Marie designed the rough layout of the city so we can see where which buildings are and based on that, I'm now creating the walkable layout. 
          <br>The city itself is divided into 3 districts with their own style of houses. In addition, the plan is to partially adapt plants to the districts as well. With increasing magic in the world, these plants should also look more magical. So, a lot of assets are needed here.... 
          <br>I have designed a system for creating the streets and have already implemented a part for testing. The following image is a test scene of a part of the city and is definitely not final. 
          <br> However, we want to keep the green aspect in the city and not pave everything over!

          </a>
          <br>

          <br> <b>Character concepts </b>
          <br> The illustration-raw concepts for Lyris (Bachelorette, human) and Ky'rah (Bachelorette, Ki'shen) are done. Lura helped us with these and continues to do a super job! Thank you, Lura! 
          <br>
          <br>  <b>Outlook</b>
          <br>  The next two weeks will still be focused on animal animations and the city, as well as general improvements here and there for my own change. 
          <br>  So, it doesn't sound that exciting, but we'll see what else comes along! 
          <br>
          <br>This weekend is also Global Game Jam. I'm going to take part in it and program one or two little puzzle games that can eventually serve as a little mini-game in Magical Harvest. Let's see! I will report on that as well! 
          <br> 
          <br> Hopefully Hogwarts Legacy won't distract us too much. Will you play it as well? 
          <br>
         <br>
         <br> Best regards, 
         <br> Your Magical Harvest Team 
         <br> Isa & Marie

       <h2>January 15, 2023  - Homepage Update</h2>

         <p>

              <a href="images/blog/2023/Jan_01_2023.png" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/blog/2023/Jan_01_2023.png" alt="2023" class ="blogImagesRight"></img>
              </a>
              Happy new year!
              <br> Our first news in 2023! My year started with my family visit to Germany, which I had to postpone in November because of Corona. Therefore, the work on the game itself stopped a bit. But of course I didn't rest even on the trip. I used the time to update the homepage, among other things.  
              <br>
              <br><b>Homepage update: Bachelor/ettes descriptions</b>
              <br>The homepage has been revised. You will now find under the heading "Cast" all fixed planned Bachelors and Bachelorettes and their descriptions. Illustrations will be finished one by one by our dear Lura. 
              <br>We hope you find the choice of our bachelors/ettes interesting and that there is something for everyone. We tried to create personalities that are not so common in farm games and also some that we like ourselves, obviously. Of course, you won't have a real idea until all the illustrations are done. 
              <br>
              <br> In addition, there is now a press kit that summarizes the MH project in order to be able to approach potential investors in the future (we still have practically no financial support. Thanks here to our two patreons who support us!). 
              <br>
              <br><b>Animals and cross-breeding </b>
              <br> In Magical Harvest it is possible to cross breed animals magically. The corresponding minigame is now implemented in its base. Animals are still the central development point at the moment. Creating the 3D models, the textures, icons and animations takes a lot of time, but it's coming along! 
              <br>
              <a href="images/blog/2023/architecture.png" target="_blank">
                <img src="images/blog/2023/architecture.png" alt="architecture" class ="blogImagesRight"></img>
              </a>
              <br><b>Architecture </b>
              <br>Marie is currently sitting on the design of the buildings for all 3 factions. I started creating the first building models from the concepts so far. We will probably go modular and create walls, windows, and roofs independently, then assemble the houses as we like. 
               
              
              <br>
              <br> <b>Outlook</b>
              <br>Animals will continue to be a central topic. I want to finish this part of the game first, before I start the next big programming part (NPCs). 
              <br>In between, however, I will create the first assets for our city. I'm really looking forward to that! 
              <br> Marie will continue to work on the concept of the city. 
      
          <br>
          <br> Best regards, 
          <br> Your Magical Harvest Team
